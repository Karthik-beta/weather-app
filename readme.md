## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project, you can clone the repository using git:

git clone : `https://github.com/Karthik-beta/weather-app.git`

Once you have cloned the repository, you can open the index.html file in a web browser to use the app. Don't forget to replace the apiKey variable in the `script.js` file with your own OpenWeatherMap API key.


## How to Use

To use the Weather App, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Enter the name of the location you want to check the weather for in the input field, and press the "Search" button. The app will then display the current weather conditions for that location.

## Technical Details

The Weather App is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the Fetch API to make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve weather data. The app then parses the data and displays the relevant information to the user.

### The app consists of three main files:

* `index.html`: The HTML file that contains the structure of the web page.
* `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the styles and layout of the web page.
* `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the code that fetches and displays the weather data.

## API Key

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need an API key. You can obtain a free API key by signing up on the OpenWeatherMap website. Once you have your API key, replace the apiKey variable in the script.js file with your own API key.
